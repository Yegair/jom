# jom

*jom* is a Kotlin/JVM parser combinator library. 
It is heavily inspired by the great Rust library
[nom](https://github.com/Geal/nom).

> *jom* is currently under active development. 
> There are no releases and no documentation yet.
> However if you want to try it out have a look at the
> [existing examples](src/test/kotlin/io/yegair/jom/examples).
> 
> Since *jom* is a more or less complete port of [nom](https://github.com/Geal/nom),
> you can also have a look at the [nom documentation](https://docs.rs/nom/6.1.0/nom/).
