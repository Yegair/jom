<p>
    <em>jom</em> is distributed as a Maven package via the
    {' '}<a href="https://search.maven.org/artifact/io.yegair.jom/jom" target="_blank">central repository</a>.
    The most recent version is <ProjectVersion/>.
</p>

## Gradle

```kotlin title="build.gradle.kts"
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    implementation("io.yegair.jom:jom:$jomVersion")
}
```

## Maven

```xml title="pom.xml"
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.yegair.jom</groupId>
  <artifactId>jom</artifactId>
  <version>${jom.version}</version>
</dependency>
```

## Transitive Dependencies

jom depends on and makes heavy use of [Okio](https://square.github.io/okio/) for consuming input.
Okio itself is written in Kotlin and depends on the Kotlin standard library.
Thus jom has exactly two runtime dependencies: Okio and the Kotlin standard library.

### Why Okio instead of Java InputStream and Reader?

jom is intended to parse text as well as binary data equally well.
Okio treats both type of input the same (`Source`),
whereas Java treats them differently (`InputStream` and `Reader`).
Without Okio jom wouldn't easily be able to provide a single API for parsing both types of data.

However, I am aware that libraries with transitive dependencies may have some drawbacks,
regarding version conflicts and final application size.
The decision for using Okio has been made because the benefits of using it by far outweigh the drawbacks of a
transitive dependency.
